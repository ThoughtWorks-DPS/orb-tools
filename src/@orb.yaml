  Orb jobs and commands for creating, testing, and publishing Orbs. Similar to the CircleCI/orb-tols-orb,
  yet optimized for trunk based development workflows.

  Provides orb development support for 

  * Teams engaged in trunk based development (or TBD)
  * Modifications to logic in iynere/compare-url to support TBD
  * Alpine-based executor
  * "Insert-Here" testing model.

  Note: Does not require a specific testing model. The typical workflow allows for test steps wherever desired.
