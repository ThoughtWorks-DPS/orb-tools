# src/examples/standard-pipeline.yaml

description: |
  A typical orb lifecycle pipeline. Git push triggers publishing of a dev version of
  the orb with both @dev:SHA and @dev:latest version tags.

  If you select 'Approve Release' the job will calculate the type of semantic change
  and publish the semantically versioned orb. See the release-tag job for details of
  how the semantic change is calculated.
